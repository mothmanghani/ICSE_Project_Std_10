# Theme fonts for User Interface components
# These specify font and font sizes for most of the interface components
# if using a crossplatform setting for bluej.lookandfeel. When using a
# system lookandfeel UI fonts are derived from the OS settings.
# This is the name of a font face with an optional "-bold" at the end.
# The theme fonts are only used if bluej.useTheme flag is true and the 
# bluej.lookandfeel property has been uncommented and set to crossplatform.
# Note: the use of theme flag and specification and non-standard fonts
# may affect bluej startup time (not confirmed for all systems)

# Use theme, which means interface and menu fonts can be specified.

bluej.fontsize=12
